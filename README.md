# Connect-Four-Game-
Connect Four is a classic two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The goal is simple: be the first to connect four discs in a row â€” vertically, horizontally, or diagonally!  This project is a digital version of the popular board game, built using modern web technologies.
